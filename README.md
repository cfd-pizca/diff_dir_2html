# diff_dir_2html

`diff_dir_2html` helps create an HTML diff between two directories. It wraps `git diff --no-index` and renders the output as a collapsible web page.

## Usage

```bash
./diff_dir_2html.sh [-e PATTERN] <dir1> <dir2> [output]
```

- `-e PATTERN` can be repeated to exclude files whose path matches a POSIX
extended regular expression.
- `<dir1>` and `<dir2>` are the directories to compare.
- `[output]` optional path to the resulting HTML file. If omitted, the file is named `diff_<dir1>_<dir2>.html` in the current directory. If the path ends with `/`, the directory is created and the filename is generated automatically. Commit hashes for each directory appear in the page header instead of the filename.

Exclude patterns are applied after the directories are copied to a temporary location, so files matching the patterns do not appear in the diff.
Version control directories such as `.git/`, `.hg/`, `.svn/`, `.bzr/` and `CVS/` are skipped automatically to keep the diff free from repository metadata.
Temporary paths are stripped from the diff output so that file references show the original directory names.

The script produces an HTML page where directories, files and even individual hunks can be expanded or collapsed. Sections are nested to mirror the directory structure of the compared trees.

## Requirements

- `git` – for generating the diff.
- `aha` – converts ANSI colored output to HTML.
- `python3` – install dependencies from [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)
  with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (currently only `jinja2`).

## Files

- `diff_dir_2html.sh` – main entry point.
- `assemble_diff.py` – combines the diff with a Jinja2 HTML template.
- `diff_collapse.js` – adds collapsible sections and injects metadata.
- `diff_style.css` – minimal styles for the page.

The HTML template `diff_template.html.j2` and optional stylesheet `diff_style.css` are expected to be present when invoking the script.

### Collapsible hierarchy

The HTML diff is organised to mirror the directory tree. Directories, files and even individual hunks are collapsible sections nested inside one another. The root directory is expanded by default so you can immediately browse the top-level files.

## Example and CI/CD

The repository includes an `example/` directory with two simple Python projects in
`case1` and `case2`. A GitHub Actions workflow builds an HTML diff between these
cases using `diff_dir_2html.sh` and publishes the result as GitHub Pages. The
resulting page demonstrates the output generated by this tool. You can view it
